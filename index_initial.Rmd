# Introduction

## Header 2

### Header 3

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For example, you can include **Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text.  For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You should test out updating your GitHub Pages website:

- clone your group's blog project repo in RStudio
- update "Your Project Title Here" to a new title in the YAML header
- knit `index.Rmd` 
- commit and push BOTH the `index.Rmd` and the `index.html` files
- go to https://stat231-f20.github.io/Blog-LetsGetFiscal/ to see the published test document (this is publicly available!)

## Including code and plots

You can embed code as normal, for example:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Let's clean up the format of that output:

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
#US locations; except Hawaii and Alaska
us_stars <- starbucks %>%
  filter(Country=="US") %>%
  rename(State=`State/Province`) %>%
  filter(State!="AK") %>%
  filter(State!="HI")
  
usa <- map_data(map = "state"
                       , region = ".")
usa_states <- usa %>%
  select(region, group) %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(
    group=sum(group)/n()
  )

state_info <- data.frame(state_full = tolower(state.name)
                         , State = state.abb
                         , Region = state.region)

us_map_star <- us_stars %>%
  left_join(state_info, by = "State") %>%
  left_join(usa_states, by = c("state_full" = "region"))

us <- map_data(map = "state"
                       , region = ".") 

library(tmap)

usa_states <- map_data(map = "state"
                       , region = ".")

city_star <- us_map_star %>%
  group_by(City) %>%
  summarize(
    Count = n()
  )

city_count_star <- us_map_star %>%
  left_join(city_star, by = "City") %>%
  mutate(Count = round(Count, 1))

#STARBUCKS LOCATIONS IN THE US
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = usa_states, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group), color="black", fill="gray", alpha=0.3) +
  geom_point(data=city_count_star, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, group=group), color = "#006d2c", alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_void() +
  scale_size(guide = "none") 
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
