# Introduction
Starbucks’ gargantuan $26 billion of revenue in 2019 is resounding evidence that Americans, above everything, love their coffee. They prove it time and time again, most recently during the current pandemic: some, unable to relinquish their daily ‘bucks, waited hours on end in long drive-thru lines to get their fix when coffee shops were closed for in-person operations. 
	
It is no surprise, then, that Starbucks owns more than 8,000 stores across the US, and continues to grow everyday. These sheer numbers are reflective of a company that is about more than just coffee, having a significant influence on US society and culture with (often controversial) initiatives such as removing religious references from holiday-themed cups. In addition, Starbucks is known for treating their employees extremely well by providing health coverage, tuition coverage, and 401(k) plans, which again reinforces their highly-regarded brand.

As such, the astounding popularity of the chain in the country and the prospect of further expansion raises important questions. What can the current distribution of Starbucks stores tell us about societal factors across the country? Which factors should the brand consider when expanding into new locations? How can companies like Starbucks, which pride themselves in a positive social and environmental outlook, incorporate such values into their corporate strategy - especially in the current pandemic?

# Distribution of Starbucks Across the US

```{r figure1, echo = FALSE}

  rename(State=`State/Province`) %>%
  filter(State!="AK") %>%

usa <- map_data(map = "state"
                       , region = ".")

  select(region, group) %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarize(
    group=sum(group)/n()

                         , State = state.abb

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
